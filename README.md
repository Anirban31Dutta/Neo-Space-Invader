# Neo-Space-Invader

Neo-Space-Invader is a Python arcade-style game built using **Pygame**. Blast through waves of enemies, score points, and enjoy the retro feel of the classic Space Invaders — now with a modern menu interface.

## Gameplay
When you launch the game, a menu screen appears with two options: **Start Game** (begins the game) and **Quit** (exits the application). Enemies move across the screen and descend toward your spaceship. Shoot enemies to increase your score. The game ends when an enemy collides with your spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Controls
Menu Navigation: Use the **Arrow Keys** to move between options and **Enter** to select.  
In-Game: Use the **← / → Arrow Keys** to move the spaceship horizontally and **Space Bar** to shoot bullets.

## How to Run
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy

git clone https://github.com/Anirban31Dutta/Neo-Space-Invader.git
cd Neo-Space-Invader
python main.py
```
